            2. When should I plan to arrive for the airshow?
    </div>
    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
                Our gates open at 11:00 on Sunday.  It is best to arrive well before 1:00 as the line to get in will often back up with late arriving guests just before show time.
        </li>
    </ul>  

    <div class="q">
       3. How long is the airshow?
    </div>
    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
                The Airshow starts at 2:30, and runs about 90 minutes, after the airshow we allow the audience to come on to the airfield and meet the pilots and other airshow performers for about 30 minutes.

    <div class="q">
           4. Do you accept credit cards or checks?

            Cash/checks/Visa and MasterCard are all accepted for entrance to the airshow, for purchases at the gift shop and for airplane rides.  The snack bar (Fifi’s Café), currently only accepts cash, but we expect to accept credit cards later this season.

            5. How can I avoid waiting in line to get in?
    </div>
    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            We have both a CASH ONLY and a CASH/CREDIT/CHECK line for entrance to the airshow, Because of the new “chip” credit cards, it takes a bit longer to process each transaction, So to avoid the lines use the CASH ONLY line as it moves much faster!

    </ul>

    <div class="q">
            6. Do I need to bring my own chair/blanket, or do you have seating available?

    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            While you are welcome to bring you own chairs/blankets, We have multiple rows of bench seats (will seat several hundred). The area is grass covered, but it is mowed & quite level.

            There is handicapped parking in the area immediately behind the audience seating area.  Depending on the row you wish to sit in, it is only 10-50 feet from the car to a bench.  You are also welcome to bring your own lawn chairs and sit in the same area.  The area is grass covered, but it is mowed & quite level.  This area is also adjacent to the restrooms.

            A cancellation notice is posted on the scrolling banner message on the Flying Circus Airshow home page. Additionally, the voice mail on our phone (540-439-8661) is updated with a cancellation notice. Your best option is to check the phone message, as it can be updated immediately from the airport.

    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            We try to let everyone know as soon as possible on the day of the show. Weather predictions are not always reliable, and the weather in DC or Fairfax, may be quite different then what we see in Bealeton. Usually we post the cancellation notice between 09:00-10:00.

    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            We open the gate (and start the ride operation) at 11:00, and continue until about 1:45. After the airshow (~4:30) we resume the ride operation until all rides are finished, or it gets too late to continue flying.

    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            The simple answer is to buy your ride ticket early.  If you delay until 1:30 to buy you ticket, you may have to wait until after the airshow when we resume the ride operation.

            13. Can I reserve an airplane ride in advance?

            14. Can I choose the airplane I want to ride in?
    </div>
    <ul class="noBullets">
        <li class="a">
            Our pilots take turns in rotation to distribute the rides evenly amongst all pilots. We will try to accommodate special requests for a particular pilot or aircraft. But we may have to send other riders up ahead of you until that pilot/airplane comes up in the rotation.  Additionally, if you are requesting a particular aircraft for a standard ride, and the aircraft is primarily used for aerobatic rides, or double (two passenger) ride, you may have to wait until all those specialty rides are finished before we could put you in the airplane for a standard ride. 
        </li>
