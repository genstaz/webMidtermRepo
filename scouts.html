        <h3>Scouts are welcome to camp at the Flying Circus Aerodrome year-round. We do have a few rules regarding camping at the airport, these are mainly for the safety of the campers and the pilots using the airport:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Permission for camping is required, and can be obtained by contacting the FCA Scouting coordinator, Joe Callen (Scouts@FlyingCircusAirshow.com), or the Flying Circus (Info@FlyingCircusAirshow.com).</li>
            <li>There will be no camping on the runway/hanger side of the fence.</li>
            <li>Please do not enter any of the hangers/buildings on the airport without the approval of a Flying Circus Staff member.</li>
            <li>Adult supervision and caution are required when using any of the fields on the runway/hanger side of the fence --- Remember there are two grass runways, and you may be right in the middle of one and not even realize it. While airport traffic is rare on non-airshow days, planes do use the airport.</li>
            <li>Camp fires are permitted, but they must be supervised by an adult or a Scout with the "Fire'em" Chit (or Girl Scout equivalent).</li>
            <li>If your troop is not planning to stay for the airshow, please plan to depart by 11:00 AM on Sunday.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are both restrooms and several Port-a-John's on the airport, and there are water spigots behind the snack bar and behind the restroom building. There are also ample picnic tables.</p>
        <p>To show our support for scouting, we have instituted special discount admissions for Scouts and their leaders. These rate will be in effect throughout the airshow season for Uniformed Scout Groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Daisy/Brownie/Girl Scouts (3-12 yrs.) --- $10.00</li>
            <li>Cub/Webelos/Boy Scouts (3-12 yrs. ) ----- $10.00</li>
            <li>Girl Scouts/Boy Scouts/Adult Leaders ---- $15.00</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All Scouts and Leaders should be in Full Uniform (per your BSA/GSA units standards).</p>

        <article class="scoutsArticle"> NOTE: Scout Group Rates Are Not Available during the Annual Hot Air Balloon Festival Weekend</article>

        <article class="scoutsArticle">Please have one of your leaders collect the admission fees and bring them to the gate, along with the count of leaders/scouts from your unit.</article>
  
        <article class="scoutsArticle">The Airshow starts at 2:30 pm (gates open at 11 am) and the show ends at 4:30 pm. Airplane rides are available before and after the show (purchase ride tickets at the gift shop).</article>

        <article class="scoutsArticle">If you have any questions, please send me an email.</article>
